        Hello, I’m Lucas. I’m a software developer, but before I became a dev I was a civil engineer in Brazil. 
        That experience of working with very diverse groups of people every day in a stressful, fast-paced environment, 
        translated great when I started working on the Microverse program, an online school for learning full-stack development. 
        There, I completed several projects using JavaScript, React, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. We developed websites, to-do list apps, 
        APIs, apps for booking appointments, and many others. To see all of my projects make sure to check out my GitHub profile! 
        This was all done through pair programming with people from all over the world. <br/>
        Growing up people always told me I was a leader and a great logical thinker, and that’s 
        what led me to study engineering. Later I found that development would be a better match for my logical skills, 
        and I fell in love with it, so that’s when I made the switch. Currently, I have finished the technical curriculum of 
        the Microverse program and I’m honing the skills I've acquired, as well as picking up some new tools and technologies. 
        I’m also looking forward to completing the whole program. The experience of learning not only about development and sharpening 
        my soft skills, but also meeting people from all sorts of different cultures has been delightful.
